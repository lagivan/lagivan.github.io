Hi, I'm __Ivan Lagunov__ and I’m a __Software Engineer__ specialized in Java EE and XML data transformations.

I have a broad range of interests but I'm mostly devoted to IT and software development. In spare time I'm busy writing a programming blog, studying MOOC, doing sports and travelling.

I was born in Izhevsk, a small city in European Russia. At the end of the secondary school I found myself rather keen on programming. In 2004 I entered [St. Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics](http://en.ifmo.ru/en/page/47/Public_and_professional_recognition.htm) which I graduated 6 years later with an advanced knowledge of Computer Science. In 2006 I started a professional career in St. Petersburg. In 2012 I moved to the Netherlands. Currently I work as a Technical Lead / Software Architect at [Semaku](http://semaku.com/).
