Passionate about technology and innovation, I lead the __R&D team__ at __ZNAPZ__, where we tackle complex problems and develop 
high-quality solutions. My expertise spans across __frontend and backend web development__, __mobile app development__, __DevOps__, 
and __cloud technologies__. Currently, I'm focused on leading the development of cutting-edge solutions within the 
enterprise asset management domain, particularly centered around __IBM Maximo__.

While my interests are diverse, my heart lies in IT and technical management. I'm constantly learning and expanding my 
knowledge across various technologies, like the potential of AI in streamlining enterprise processes, along with modern 
trends and leadership aspects. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my wonderful wife and son, learning new 
things, staying active through sports, and exploring the world through travel.

Born and raised in Izhevsk, Russia, I discovered my passion for programming during my high school years. In 2004, I 
began my academic journey at [St. Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics](http://en.ifmo.ru/en/page/47/Public_and_professional_recognition.htm), 
graduating six years later with a Master's degree in Computer Science. My professional career kicked off in 
St. Petersburg in 2006, and I later relocated to the Netherlands. Over the years, I've gained invaluable experience 
working with diverse clients, leading distributed teams, and delivering impactful projects.
