Hi, I'm __Ivan Lagunov__ and I’m a __Senior IT Consultant__ and __R&D Team Lead__. Together with my team we specialize
in solving complex enterprise problems and developing high quality solutions. Our area of expertise covers Frontend and
Backend Web/Mobile Development and DevOps. We offer excellent services in software development and consultancy.

I have a broad range of interests but I'm mostly devoted to IT and software development. I'm genuinely interested in all
aspects of software technology and have deep knowledge of Java EE, SQL/NoSQL databases, XML-related technologies,
Semantic Web, algorithms and data structures. In spare time I'm busy self-learning, writing a programming blog, doing
sports and travelling.

I was born in Izhevsk, a small industrial city in European Russia. At the end of the secondary school I found myself
rather keen on programming. In 2004 I entered my alma mater [St. Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics](http://en.ifmo.ru/en/page/47/Public_and_professional_recognition.htm)
which I graduated 6 years later with an advanced knowledge of Computer Science. In 2006 I started a professional career
in St. Petersburg. In 2012-2016 I lived in the country with the best bicycle culture (the Netherlands, of course) working
for a leading global semiconductor company NXP. Since I moved back to St. Petersburg, I'm busy working with external
customers and managing a small R&D team.
